# VRoomba
> Making cleaning fun!

## Game Essence
Our game is an VR tank defense game in which you shoot down increasing waves of enemies. 

The game turns a Roomba into a self moving tank with a top mounted 360 camera. The player will use a VR headset (e.g. Google Cardboard) to become the gunner on the top of the tank. Now you can have fun defending your Roomba from increasing waves of enemies while cleaning your room.
